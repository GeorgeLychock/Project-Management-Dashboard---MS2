## Use Case:
A configurable user dashboard that displays and organizes key metrics and data from third-party datastreams such as a project schedule, a to do list, or a project metrics aggregator. The third-party datastream can come from a sister API to the dashboard app or some API from a vendor such as Smartsheet. These datastreams are congifured as widget objects that can be added and removed from the main dashboard viewport. A widget library is visible as a side menu giving the user the ablility click various widgets on, and off, the main dashboard viewport.
A limited number of widget view settings will be available from the widget window once the widget is added to the main dahsboard viewport.

### Technical Contraints
Use JSON objects to simulate/fill widget data streams.

### (Jasmine) Test Sequences:
-   Create a library button that turns a div ON in the active widet viewport
-   Create a library button that turns a div ON in the active widet viewport
-   display a library widget item as an object in a side menu structure
